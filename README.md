# 3D Game with Three.js
 This was my term project for Computer Graphics course I took during MSc IT. I am using Three.js and other libraries to model the character and trees. Camera angle is from 3rd person perspective and can rotate 360 any direction. Controls are simple arrow keys. 
 
 Concept:
 
  A tressure is hidden which has a lock that can only be broken by a special hammer. Both tressure and hammer are hidden in the forst.
  Once you are in the proximity of either of them, they will become visible.
  Once you have the hammer and find the tressure then only it will open and you will be victorious.
  
I have added sound as well just for the effect. Hope you enjoy. XD
